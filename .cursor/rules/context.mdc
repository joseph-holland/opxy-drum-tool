- global state lives exclusively in `AppContext` (React context + reducer) â€“ do not introduce other global state libraries (redux, recoil, zustand, etc.)
- interact with global state via `useAppContext()` and dispatch predefined action types in `AppContext.tsx`
- for transient ui state (modals, tooltips) use local `useState` in the component
