# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.2.1] - Patch Size Calculation Fixes  
- Fixed patch size calculations to be more accurate for all conversion scenarios
- Corrected sample rate conversion logic to use exact target rates (not minimum of source/target)
- Improved bit depth conversion to use exact target bit depths for size calculations
- Enhanced mono conversion detection to properly account for stereo-to-mono downmixing
- Added helper functions for accurate sample count calculation after conversions
- Patch size now correctly reflects original file size when no conversions are applied
- Fixed edge cases where conversion detection was inconsistent

## [v1.2.0] - Import feature and bit depth
- Allow import of patch.json to copy engine settings from existing presets
- Added bit depth conversion feature (keep original, 16-bit, 24-bit)
- Added channel conversion feature (keep original, convert to mono)
- Intelligent conversion logic prevents meaningless upconversion (16→24-bit, mono→stereo)
- Enhanced patch size calculations account for sample rate, bit depth, and channel conversions
- Added comprehensive patch summary with conversion statistics and warnings
- Session persistence for dropdown settings (sample rate, bit depth, channels)
- Visual sample info display with conversion indicators and FontAwesome icons
- Real-time patch size updates when conversion settings change
- Mixed format warnings for patches with varying bit depths, sample rates, or channels

## [v1.1.0] - Major UI/UX Overhaul & Recording Feature
- UI/UX improvements and fixes
- Can now drag folders of samples into multisample tool
- New recording feature for samples
- Session management: Tab persistence remembers last selected tool (drum/multisample) and expand/collapse of sections
- Performance: Optimised waveform drawing and marker rendering

## [v1.0.0] - Initial Release
- Initial project setup and feature implementation.
- Forked from https://buba447.github.io/opxy-drum-tool
- Basic drum and multisample patch generation for OP-XY
- Drag-and-drop sample loading
- Advanced preset settings
