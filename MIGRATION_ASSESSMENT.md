## Technical Debt & Issues Found

### 1. Audio Context Management
```typescript

// ... later
await audioContext.close();
```
**Problem:** Creates new AudioContext for each file, wasteful
**Solution:** Implement singleton AudioContext manager

### 2. Incomplete Type Definitions
```typescript
// Missing proper types in AppContext
export interface AppState {
  // Current state is too simplified
}
```
**Solution:** Add comprehensive type definitions

### 3. Carbon Theme Implementation
**Issue:** Basic theme applied, but missing component-specific overrides
**Solution:** Complete Carbon theme customization

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Week 1: Core Foundation
- Complete audio processing utilities
- Implement AudioContext manager
- Create waveform editor component

### Week 2: Component Development
- Build advanced sample controls
- Implement patch size indicators
- Create bulk edit functionality

### Week 3: Tool Enhancement
- Complete drum tool features
- Complete multisample tool features
- Add keyboard mapping

### Week 4: Advanced Features & Testing
- Implement recording functionality
- Add session management
- Create comprehensive test suite

## Success Metrics

1. **Feature Parity:** 100% of legacy functionality migrated
2. **Performance:** No regression in audio processing speed
3. **User Experience:** Improved accessibility and usability
4. **Code Quality:** 90%+ test coverage
5. **Bundle Size:** Optimized for web delivery

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Audio processing complexity:** Complex WAV parsing and manipulation
- **Browser compatibility:** AudioContext API limitations
- **Performance:** Large audio file handling

### Medium Risk
- **Carbon integration:** Custom theming challenges
- **State management:** Complex audio state synchronization

### Low Risk
- **Component development:** Straightforward React components
- **Testing:** Standard testing approaches

## Conclusion

The migration is well-started but requires significant additional work to achieve feature parity. The foundation is solid, but approximately 60-65% of functionality still needs to be implemented. With focused development following this plan, the migration can be completed in 3-4 weeks of full-time development.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Complete audio processing utilities
2. Implement waveform editor component
3. Add missing drum tool features
4. Create comprehensive test suite

The legacy codebase provides excellent reference material, and the migration approach should preserve all existing functionality while improving maintainability and user experience.
